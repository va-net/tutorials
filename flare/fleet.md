# Fleet Management in Flare

In Flare, the way aircraft are managed may be different to what some people are used to, for a few reasons.

1. You should only add 1 aircraft to Flare per type/livery that you operate. For example, if you operate 21 B737s and 12 A320s, then you just add a 737 type and an A320 type to Flare. However, if you operate multiple liveries on one type - for example 10 BA A320s plus 3 codeshared AA A320s - you should a British Airways A320 and an American Airlines A320.
2. Pre-defined Aircraft/Livery Options. Through VANet, Flare is able to fetch all aircraft currently available in Infinite Flight and present them in dropdowns. Aircraft have to be selected this way so that Flare is able to effectively work with VANet to run ACARS (VANet Gold subscribers only). However, in case you operate multiple generic aircraft, a comments field is also included which will be shown everywhere the aircraft is.
3. Special Livery handling. Due to the limitations outlined above, special liveries must be added separately to normal liveries to ensure ACARS is able to work correctly.

For these reasons, please ensure you consider the following when adding aircraft aircraft to Flare.

- Add one aircraft per type/livery combination (generic livery excluded)
- If using the generic livery, include some notes to explain what it's representing.
- Always add Special Liveries as well as the standard variation.
