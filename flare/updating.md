# Updating Flare

Flare comes with a built-in updater to make staying up-to-date easy. The updater is available to staff with access on the **Site Settings** page under the **Updates** tab. We recommend that you check this page regularly, as Flare hotfixes can come as often as every few days and updates may come every 1-2 weeks.

Updating is super simple. If there's a new update available, you'll be presented with this screen.

Just click the **Update Now** button and Flare will update itself without even reloading the page. <u>You must not close the page while updates are in progress!!!</u> Please note that updates will override any changes you may have made to Flare's source code. Furthermore, not all updates support the updater. Some major versions may require that you upload the files manually, but this is rare.
