# Installing a Plugin

Installing a Plugin in Flare is designed to be quick and simple. Simply navigate to the Plugins Store by going into **Plugins > Manage Plugins** where you will be presented with the plugin store by default. All plugins are presented in a searchable and filterable table. All plugins have their name shown, as well as their tags. Tags are added by plugin developers to help the plugin come up in a search. Plugins tagged with the *official* tag are plugins made by the VANet team and are recommended to enhance your experience with Flare. Furthermore, if you hover over the plugin name you will be presented with a short description of what the plugin does.

Once you've found the plugin you wish to install, just click the download button. Loading may take some time, but once it's done, you instantly ready to go. Most plugins include some sort of admin interface, so we recommend checking that out before introducing it to your pilots.
