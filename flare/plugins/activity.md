# Flare Activity Plugin

The Flare Activity Plugin is a plugin developed by VANet Developer Kai M to help track pilot activity and LOA. 

## Post-Installation

After installing the activity plugin, you should head to the **Activity Settings** page available under the **Plugins** menu. You'll probably notice Activity has added quite a few items to your menu.

- Admin Menu: Activity Settings (under Plugins)
- Admin Menu: Activity (under User Management)
- Admin Menu: LOA Admin (under User Management)
- Pilot Menu: Leave of Absence

Each of these pages serves a specific purpose as outlined below.

## Activity Settings

This page is where you can set what is shown as "inactive". The PIREP Requirement by default is 1 PIREP per 30 Days, and pilots are considered a New Pilot for 14 days and must file a PIREP in this time or be marked as inactive. Both these options can be changed to suit your VA.

## Activity

This page is the heart of this plugin. It shows a searchable table of all your pilots, along with their Activity Status (as defined by the settings), and includes the ability to Retire inactive pilots. This page also shows retired pilots with a button to unretire them.

## Leave of Absence

Another main function of this plugin is the ability for pilots to put in for Leave of Absence. Upon putting in for LOA, a request is marked as Pending. Pending requests are shown at the top of the LOA Admin page and can be accepted or denied as appropriate. Approved requests that are upcoming or current are shown below this. Furthermore, when a pilot is On Leave, they will show as such in the **Activity** page.
