# Plugins in Flare

Flare is unique as it offers a range of certified plugins to extend its capability. All plugins are managed through the Plugin Store, which pulls from the Plugins Repository available [here](https://github.com/va-net/flare-plugins). Documentation is available for many plugins right here on VANet.

## Developing a Plugin

Got a cool idea for a way to extend Flare? We welcome third-party developers to develop plugins and submit them to the Plugins Store. If you're interested, check out the example plugin on GitHub. More documentation on extending Flare is planned in the future.
