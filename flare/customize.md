# Customizing Flare

Flare is designed to be customizable to fit your VA's Brand. This can be done on your site under **Site Settings**, 
which can be found by staff members with access under the **Operations Management** Dropdown.

Here, you can set various options. These include your VANet API Key, VA Name and the theme color of your site. All colors must be 
in [Color Hex Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet). Once you've made your chosen changes, simply click **Save**, refresh the page and your new
theme will be applied.
