# Codeshare Agreements in Flare

Flare implements the Easy Codeshare System offered by VANet to allow you to send routes to your codeshare partners with ease, and receive and import routes from other VAs with a single click.

## Sending Routes

To send routes to another VA, first go to the **Manage Codeshares** page of Flare, which is under the **Operations Management** dropdown.

Once on the codeshares page, scroll down to the **Make Codeshare Request** heading. First, you must enter the Codesharing ID of the recipient of these routes. There is no public directory of these IDs, so the VA you are sending the routes to you must provide you with their ID. Next, you need to enter the routes you are sending to the other VA. <u>These are the routes from your database.</u> If I wanted to send routes ABC123, ABC321 and ABC456 I would enter `ABC123, ABC321, ABC456`. Optionally, you can also include a message that the VA will see upon receiving these routes. Click Send, and if everything is valid the routes will be uploaded to VANet, waiting for the other VA to receive and import them.

## Receiving Routes

If you wish for another VA to send you routes, you must first provide them with your Codesharing ID. This can be found on your VANet VA Profile [here](https://vanet.app/airline/profile). Once they've sent you the routes, navigate to the **Manage Codeshares** page of Flare - found under the **Operations Management** dropdown.

Once on the codeshares page, you should see the request in the requests table. You will see the name of the VA who sent them, the message if one was included, and the number of routes. You can either either **Import** them (add them to your database) or **Decline** the routes (remove the request without importing the routes).

Once imported, the request will disappear and the routes will now be in your database. Keep in mind they will be prefixed with the airline's code that they came from.
