# Flare Flight Time Multipliers

Flare is the first Crew Center ever to implement a flight time multiplication system out of the box. By adding a six-digit multiplier code when filing a PIREP, the flight time will automatically be multiplied - but only if the multiplier is valid.

For example, if you want to give pilots 2x Flight Time when they fly a Route of the Week, you could add a ROTW Multiplier. To do this, go into **PIREP Management > Manage Multipliers** then scroll down to the **Add Multiplier** section. Here, you can enter a name for the multiplier (ROTW in our example), and a multiplication (in our case, 2). To ensure it is unique, multipliers codes are generated by Flare.

A multiplier becomes active as soon as it is added. If you wish to stop pilots from using the multiplier, simply delete it. <u>Deleting a multiplier does not affect pilots that have already used it.</u>

When reviewing PIREPs, the multiplier used is displayed to allow the reviewer to ensure it has been used correctly.
